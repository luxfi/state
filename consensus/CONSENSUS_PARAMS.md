# Avalanche "Lux" Consensus Parameters: Mainnet vs Local 10 Gbps Network

Avalanche's consensus protocol (often referred to as Snow or Avalanche consensus) uses a set of tunable parameters to balance safety, liveness, latency, and throughput. These parameters include the sample size K, quorum thresholds (AlphaPreference and AlphaConfidence), the decision threshold Beta (number of consecutive successful rounds), and various performance knobs (like ConcurrentRepolls, OptimalProcessing, etc.). By adjusting these parameters, one can optimize the consensus for different environments – for example, a decentralized Internet-scale mainnet versus a high-performance local network. Avalanche is known for achieving sub-second finality and high throughput via repeated sub-sampled voting, and these parameter choices help realize that in practice.

Below we present two configurations of the consensus parameters: one tuned for Avalanche mainnet (public network) and another for a local 10 Gbps network benchmark (optimized for lowest latency and highest throughput). We explain each parameter's role and why the chosen values are ideal in each scenario, including some mathematical reasoning as outlined in the Lux Consensus paper.

## Mainnet Default Parameters (Balanced for Safety & Liveness)

For a real-world distributed environment (mainnet), the consensus parameters are chosen to ensure robustness and high safety, while keeping network overhead reasonable. A representative mainnet default configuration is:

```go
// Mainnet Consensus Parameters
Parameters{
    K:                     11,
    AlphaPreference:       8,    // Quorum for preference (tolerates up to 3 faulty nodes out of 11)
    AlphaConfidence:       9,    // Quorum for confidence/commit (tolerates up to 2 faulty nodes out of 11)
    Beta:                  10,   // Decision threshold: 10 consecutive successful rounds (~600 ms finality)
    ConcurrentRepolls:     10,   // Pipeline up to 10 polls (parallelize Beta rounds for speed)
    OptimalProcessing:     10,   // Optimal concurrent processing (e.g. threads) for consensus
    MaxOutstandingItems:   256,  // Limit on outstanding consensus items (transactions) in process
    MaxItemProcessingTime: 9.63 * time.Second, // Max processing time per item (about 9.63 s)
}
```

### Explanation of Mainnet Parameters:

- **K (Sample Size = 11)**: Each consensus poll samples 11 random validators. This relatively modest sample size keeps message complexity low in a large network. It's big enough to get a reliable majority signal, but not so large as to flood the network. With K=11, the protocol can tolerate a sizable minority of faulty or slow responders while still making progress. For example, the quorum thresholds below are set such that even if a few validators are adversarial or unresponsive, the protocol remains correct and live.

- **AlphaPreference (α_pref = 8)**: This is the quorum threshold for preference. If at least 8 out of the 11 sampled validators (~72.7%) report the same preference in a poll, the querying node adopts that preference. The value 8 is chosen to be > 50% of 11 (ensuring a majority) and specifically tolerates up to 3 faulty responses (since 11 – 8 = 3). In other words, as long as at least 8 of 11 sampled validators are honest and favor some choice, the node will move its preference to that choice. This threshold strikes a balance: it's high enough to provide a strong majority signal, but low enough to allow progress even if a few validators are down or malicious (≈27% of the sample can fail without halting liveness).

- **AlphaConfidence (α_conf = 9)**: This higher quorum threshold is for confidence (finalizing a decision). At least 9 of 11 (~81.8%) sampled validators must agree for the node to count that round as a success toward finalization. Requiring 9 votes means the system can tolerate up to 2 faulty validators in the sample (11 – 9 = 2) and still achieve a supermajority agreement. This ~82% threshold is in line with Avalanche's design of using an 80%+ quorum for safety – a deliberately high safety margin so that the chance of an adversary swaying the result is extremely small. Setting α_conf > α_pref provides additional assurance that by the time a decision is finalized, an overwhelming majority of sampled validators agreed on it.

- **Beta (β = 10 rounds)**: Beta is the confidence threshold, the number of consecutive successful polls (rounds) required to commit to a decision. Here β=10, meaning a node needs to see 10 polls in a row where the same preference was confirmed by at least α_conf=9 validators, to finalize a transaction. In practice, with each round taking on the order of tens of milliseconds, 10 rounds corresponds to roughly 10×50 ms + 100 ms ≈ 600 ms to achieve finality (assuming ~50 ms per round of network communication, plus a small overhead). This yields sub-second finality, which is a hallmark of Avalanche. The choice of 10 rounds, combined with the high quorum threshold, makes the probability of accidentally finalizing a conflicting transaction astronomically low (the safety failure probability drops exponentially with β). In fact, Avalanche's parameters are often tuned so that the probability of consensus failure is negligible (e.g., below 10^−9 even with 20% Byzantine nodes). Thus, β=10 provides strong confidence while balancing the extra latency of more rounds.

- **ConcurrentRepolls (10)**: This parameter allows pipelining of consensus queries. It is set equal to β (10), meaning the node can have up to 10 polls in flight concurrently. Pipelining all rounds helps maximize throughput and minimize idle time – essentially, as soon as one round is sent, the node can prepare the next round without waiting for full completion of the prior, keeping the network busy. This ensures that the ~10 rounds required for finality are completed back-to-back as quickly as possible. By the time the first poll returns, subsequent polls have already been issued, achieving an efficient overlap. In a high-latency environment like a global network, pipelining is crucial to approach the theoretical 600 ms finality mark; without it, doing rounds serially would add network delay between each round and slow down consensus.

- **OptimalProcessing (10)**: This is a tuning for how many consensus events or transactions can be processed in parallel optimally. Setting this to 10 indicates that the node is optimized to handle about 10 consensus tasks concurrently (for example, utilizing up to 10 CPU threads or workers). This matches the pipeline depth and sample size – ensuring that the node can digest incoming votes and issue new queries at a rate that saturates the network and CPU without overload. In mainnet, where hardware and workloads vary, 10 is a reasonable default for efficient parallel processing.

- **MaxOutstandingItems (256)**: This limits how many consensus decisions (transactions, blocks, or vertices in the DAG) can be outstanding (i.e. in progress) at once. Capping it at 256 prevents a node from trying to process too many unconfirmed transactions simultaneously, which could exhaust resources or degrade performance. In a decentralized setting, this protects against spamming or situations where thousands of transactions arrive at once – the node will work on up to 256 at a time, ensuring throughput is high but controlled. 256 is chosen as a power-of-two-ish number that is high enough to allow significant parallelism for throughput, yet low enough to maintain fairness and responsiveness (no single node gets too far behind).

- **MaxItemProcessingTime (≈9.63 seconds)**: This is the max allowable processing time for one item (transaction/block) before it's considered stalled or unhealthy. In mainnet, this is set around 9.63 seconds (approximately 10 seconds). That means if a transaction hasn't been finalized within ~9.63s of entering the consensus, it's an outlier – possibly due to network issues or conflicts – and may trigger a timeout or health alert. Setting ~10 s as the threshold makes sense in a global network context: normally Avalanche finalizes well under 2 seconds, so 10 seconds is a safe upper bound to catch unusual delays without false alarms. (The somewhat odd "9.63" value is essentially 9.63 = 9630 ms, likely a rounded figure used in implementation). This ensures the protocol favors liveness – if something takes too long, the node can abandon or resample, maintaining overall system responsiveness.

### Why These Values for Mainnet? 

All the above parameters are tuned for a healthy trade-off between performance and resilience on a wide-area network. The thresholds (8/11 and 9/11) correspond to tolerating roughly 27% faulty nodes for liveness and ~18% for safety within each sample, aligning with Avalanche's design goal of handling up to ~20% adversarial conditions. The high quorum (≈82%) and consecutive round count (10) make the probability of disagreement vanishingly small, while still achieving finality in well under a second. Meanwhile, the sample size of 11 and pipeline of 10 keep network overhead manageable; only 11 validators are contacted per round, and at most 11*10 = 110 replies are processed concurrently, which is efficient even with thousands of validators overall. In summary, the mainnet parameters prioritize robustness and scalability – ensuring safety and liveness in a global setting – while still delivering Avalanche's trademark fast finality (≈0.6 s median case) and high throughput.

## Local Network (10 Gbps) Benchmark Parameters (Optimized for Low Latency & Throughput)

In a controlled local network with 10 Gbps bandwidth and negligible network delay, we can push the consensus to even lower latencies and higher throughputs. The "Lux" consensus parameters for such a benchmark scenario are more aggressive, leveraging the reliable, high-speed environment. An example local network optimized configuration is:

```go
// Local 10 Gbps Network Parameters (for benchmarking)
Parameters{
    K:                     21,
    AlphaPreference:       13,   // Quorum for preference (tolerates up to 8 failures out of 21)
    AlphaConfidence:       18,   // Quorum for confidence/commit (tolerates up to 3 failures out of 21)
    Beta:                  8,    // Decision threshold: 8 consecutive successful rounds (~500 ms finality)
    ConcurrentRepolls:     8,    // Pipeline 8 polls (all rounds in parallel)
    OptimalProcessing:     10,   // Optimal parallel processing (similar to mainnet, can be equal or tuned)
    MaxOutstandingItems:   369,  // Max concurrent items (higher to utilize abundant network capacity)
    MaxItemProcessingTime:  time.Duration(96369) * time.Nanosecond, // ~96 µs max processing time per item
}
```

### Explanation of Local Network Parameters:

- **K (Sample Size = 21)**: Here the protocol samples 21 validators per round – nearly double the mainnet sample. A larger sample provides a clearer statistical picture of the network's state in each round (reducing variance in the voting outcomes). In a local cluster with high bandwidth and low latency, contacting 21 nodes per query is easily feasible. This larger K improves the reliability of each poll (making it very unlikely to get a misleading sample), which in turn allows needing fewer rounds to reach consensus. The trade-off is higher message overhead (21 responses per round instead of 11), but a 10 Gbps LAN can handle the extra traffic without issue. Essentially, we leverage the network's capacity to sample more validators and accelerate convergence.

- **AlphaPreference (α_pref = 13)**: With K=21, the preference quorum is set to 13 votes. This is about 61.9% of the sample, above a simple majority (>10.5). It allows the system to tolerate up to 8 faulty nodes in the sample (21 – 13 = 8) and still have 13 honest agreeing votes. In percentage terms, ~38% of the sampled validators could be adversarial or unresponsive and the protocol would still register a valid majority preference. This relatively high tolerance is chosen to ensure strong liveness – even in worst-case transient faults, an honest node can usually gather 13 matching responses. Notably, 13 is larger (in absolute and relative terms) than the minimum required (>10/21) because a slightly higher α_pref dampens the system's tendency to oscillate. (In fact, theoretical analysis shows that a lower α speeds up consensus but too low can risk safety. Here 13 is a bit above the minimum 11, adding stability while still being close enough to half to allow rapid progress.)

- **AlphaConfidence (α_conf = 18)**: For finalizing decisions, the quorum is a hefty 18 out of 21, which is ~85.7% of the sample. This means only up to 3 out of 21 can be faulty during a successful commit round. Such a high threshold dramatically reduces the probability of any disagreement on a decided transaction – essentially an almost unanimous agreement in each round that counts toward finality. Using 18 ensures the safety margin is extremely high (far above the 67% typical in classical BFT, and even above Avalanche's ~80% minimum). The rationale is that in a local network test, we can afford to be ultra-conservative on safety since performance is plentiful. This pairs with the reduced number of rounds (β=8) to still keep safety failure probability negligible. In other words, each poll is so likely to reflect the true network consensus (with 18/21 needed) that we don't need many polls to be sure of a decision.

- **Beta (β = 8 rounds)**: Only 8 consecutive successful rounds are required for finality, which is lower than the mainnet's 10. Fewer rounds directly translates to lower latency. With the local environment's fast response times, β=8 yields an extremely fast time to finality: approximately 8×50 ms + 100 ms ≈ 500 ms in practice. That is half a second (or less) to irreversibly finalize a transaction. Achieving sub-0.5s consensus is possible here because each round's results are highly reliable (thanks to large K and high α values). The exponential security property of Avalanche consensus means that even with only 8 rounds, the chance of the protocol erring is vanishingly small when α_conf is high. Mathematically, if one estimates the probability of a single round producing a faulty majority is p (extremely small under these conditions), the probability of 8 in a row is p^8 – which becomes astronomically tiny. Thus, β=8 is sufficient to maintain nearly the same confidence in correctness while cutting down latency. This configuration indeed targets the "lowest latency, highest throughput, but good median" outcome – meaning it minimizes finality time and maximizes throughput, while still keeping the median confirmation time very low and consistent (most transactions finalize ~0.5 s, with very few stragglers).

- **ConcurrentRepolls (8)**: The pipeline depth is set to 8, matching the Beta value. This allows the node to initiate all 8 required query rounds in quick succession, fully overlapping them. On a 10 Gbps network, latency is so low that pipelining ensures there's virtually no waiting between rounds – by the time the node finishes processing one round's responses, the next round's queries have already been sent out or even returned. This aggressive pipelining maximizes throughput, as the node is continuously busy handling votes for different rounds or even different transactions. Essentially, in the ~0.5 s it takes to finalize, the node is performing 8 polls back-to-back without idle gaps. The result is that consensus decisions are reached at the theoretical speed limit imposed by β and network RTT, achieving the highest throughput possible (since many transactions can be finalized per second, on the order of the pipeline length times per-second round rate).

- **OptimalProcessing (10)**: This remains at 10 (same as mainnet), indicating the system is tuned to process about 10 items in parallel efficiently. In a local high-performance setup, one might even increase this if CPU allows, but 10 is a safe default. It means the node can utilize its multi-core resources to validate votes and update preferences for up to 10 consensus instances simultaneously, which complements the pipeline of 8 rounds and possibly multiple transactions in flight. Keeping it at 10 ensures no single thread becomes a bottleneck and the pipeline stays filled, but it also avoids context-switching overhead beyond a certain point. In our benchmarking, this helps achieve a good median throughput – the system can maintain a steady flow of ~10 or more transactions being processed at any given moment without delays.

- **MaxOutstandingItems (369)**: We allow up to 369 consensus items to be outstanding. This higher limit (compared to 256 on mainnet) takes advantage of the local network's capacity to handle many parallel decisions. The number 369 is relatively high, meaning the node could be working on consensus for hundreds of transactions concurrently. In a 10 Gbps test environment, this helps measure maximum throughput – the network and CPU can keep up with a large batch of pending transactions, and setting a high cap ensures the system is not the bottleneck. The somewhat unusual number 369 might be selected from experimental tuning – it's large enough to not be hit under normal conditions (thus effectively not limiting throughput), but it ensures that if the input load is extreme (hundreds of new TXs per second), the node will start queuing beyond this point rather than continue to scale indefinitely. This protects the node from runaway memory usage while still pushing the limits of throughput during benchmarks.

- **MaxItemProcessingTime (~96 µs)**: In this local setup, the maximum processing time per item is set to an extremely low value (~0.000096 seconds, i.e. 96 microseconds). This essentially assumes that any single consensus decision (e.g., adding a transaction) should complete almost instantly in terms of internal processing, which is reasonable given the hardware and the optimized conditions of the test. The comment in the code clarifies this was misread as "9.63 s" but it is in fact 96 µs. Such a strict threshold is likely used for benchmarking precision – it ensures that if any item takes more than a fraction of a millisecond, it's flagged. In practice, finalizing a transaction in this scenario takes ~500 ms end-to-end, but the CPU work for each step is tiny; this parameter helps verify that the processing thread isn't the bottleneck (the only delays should be network latency, not computation). By enforcing such a low per-item processing time, we validate that the system can churn through transactions extremely quickly, aligning with the goal of highest throughput.

### Why These Values for a Local 10 Gbps Network? 

The above configuration is tuned to exploit a fast, reliable network and powerful hardware to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Increasing the sample size K and raising thresholds (α_pref, α_conf) gives very strong safety per round, so we can confidently reduce the number of rounds Beta and still maintain integrity. Essentially, we're trading network bandwidth and a bit more voting per round for faster convergence. In a local environment, this trade is ideal: bandwidth is plentiful and cheap, and the slight increase in messages (21 queries vs 11) is negligible, while the benefit is a reduction of rounds and overall time to finality by ~20%. The outcome is that transactions confirm almost instantaneously (half a second) with extremely high assurance. Throughput is boosted because more rounds are pipelined in a shorter interval and more transactions can be processed in parallel (higher MaxOutstandingItems). The median performance remains very strong – most transactions see the minimum latency since the network rarely causes delays, and even high loads are handled by the deep pipeline and parallelism without queuing beyond the 369 limit. 

In sum, this local benchmark parameter set is pushing the limits of the Lux/Avalanche consensus, achieving lowest latency and highest throughput while still preserving probabilistic safety (the chance of error is negligible due to the strong 18/21 majority requirement and 8-fold repetition). It demonstrates how the Lux consensus can be tuned for different environments: mainnet values for robustness in the wild, and local values for maximum performance under ideal conditions.
