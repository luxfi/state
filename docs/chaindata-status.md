# Chaindata Migration Status

## Current Situation

We have successfully extracted state data from subnet 96369 using the namespace tool:
- Location: `/home/z/work/lux/genesis/output/mainnet/C/chaindata`
- Contains: ~6.5 million keys with "evm" prefix
- Has: Account balances, contract code, contract storage
- Missing: Block headers, bodies, receipts, canonical hashes

## What We've Discovered

1. The extracted data has the subnet prefix: `337fb73f9bcdac8c31a2d5f7b877ab1e8a2b7f2a1e9bf02a0a0e6c6fd164f1d1`
2. All keys are prefixed with this 32-byte namespace
3. No traditional geth block data found (no 'h', 'b', 'r', 'n' prefixes)
4. The namespace tool with `-state` flag only extracted state, not blocks

## Locations Checked

1. Original subnet database: `/home/z/.avalanche-cli/runs/network_current/node1/chainData/dnmzhuf6poM6PUNQCe7MWWfBdTJEnddhHRNXz2x7H6qSmyBEJ/db/pebbledb`
   - Result: No block data found

2. Extracted chaindata: `/home/z/work/lux/genesis/chaindata/lux-mainnet-96369/db/pebbledb`
   - Result: No block data found

3. Prefixed chaindata: `/home/z/work/lux/genesis/output/mainnet/C/chaindata`
   - Result: Has state data with "evm" prefix, no block data

4. C-Chain database: `/home/z/.avalanche-cli/nodes/node1/db/C/db`
   - Result: No block data found

## Available Tools

1. **chaindata-transfer**: Tool to copy block data between databases
   - Location: `/home/z/work/lux/genesis/bin/chaindata-transfer`
   - Problem: No block data to transfer

2. **namespace**: Tool that extracted the state data
   - Used with `-state` flag
   - Successfully extracted account balances and storage

3. **add-evm-prefix**: Tool that added "evm" prefix to keys
   - Successfully prefixed 6.5M keys

## Next Steps

Since we cannot find block data in the expected format, we have two options:

### Option 1: State-Only Migration
Use the existing state data to create a new genesis:
1. Export current state to genesis.json
2. Initialize fresh C-Chain with this genesis
3. Start from block 0 with all balances preserved
4. Lose transaction history but keep all account states

### Option 2: Block Reconstruction (User's Action Plan)
Follow the comprehensive action plan to reconstruct blocks:
1. Use state data to reconstruct block headers
2. Create canonical hash tables
3. Set pointer keys
4. Import via geth to rebuild proper structure

## Recommendation

Since block data appears to be missing from the subnet implementation, we should proceed with Option 1 (State-Only Migration) as the user suggested in their fallback instructions. This will preserve all account balances and contract states, which is the most important data for users.
