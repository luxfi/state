# Mini-Lab Migration Test Summary

## Test Database Analysis

### Database Location
- Path: `/home/z/.tmp/cchain-mini/evm/pebbledb`
- Size: Contains ~2.87M keys with evm namespace prefix

### Key Findings

1. **EVMN Key Format Issue**
   - Found: 11,015 evmn keys BUT they are in wrong format
   - Subnet format: `evmn<32-byte-hash>` (34 bytes total after prefix)
   - C-Chain expects: `evmn<8-byte-number>` (12 bytes total after prefix)
   - This explains why C-Chain cannot find the canonical mappings

2. **Namespace Prefix**
   - All keys have "evm" namespace prefix (hex: 65766d)
   - Keys are structured as: `evm<type><data>`
   - Types found: evmh (headers), evmn (canonical), evmb (bodies), etc.

3. **Block Data**
   - Headers exist (evmh prefix: 65766d68)
   - Bodies exist (evmb prefix)
   - Receipts exist (evmr prefix)
   - But canonical mappings are in wrong format

## Tools Created

1. **peek_tip_simple.go** - Looks for standard format evmn keys
2. **find_tip_namespace.go** - Identifies non-standard evmn keys
3. **check_namespace_keys.go** - Analyzes all key types in database
4. **rpc_verify.sh** - Script to verify RPC endpoints after migration

## Migration Pipeline Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Created unified genesis CLI tool
- Integrated import/export functionality
- Created rebuild_canonical tools
- Added RPC verification tests
- Created namespace-aware analysis tools
- Documented findings

### ‚ùå Blocked By
- EVMN keys in subnet database use hash format instead of number format
- Need to convert `evmn<hash>` to `evmn<number>` during migration
- The fix_evmn_keys tool in the test suite should handle this conversion

### üîß Next Steps
1. Run the fix_evmn_keys tool on the migrated database
2. Verify evmn keys are in correct format after fix
3. Run consensus replay to create synthetic blockchain
4. Launch node with migrated data
5. Verify RPC returns correct block height and treasury balance

## Test Results Summary

The Ginkgo test suite failures are due to:
1. Missing migrated database in some test paths
2. RPC calls failing because no node is running
3. Some build errors in test migration tools

The core issue is that subnet databases store canonical mappings differently than C-Chain expects. This is a known issue that the migration pipeline needs to handle.
