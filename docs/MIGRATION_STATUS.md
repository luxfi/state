# Migration Status Report

## Summary
The genesis migration tools have been updated to support migrating Subnet EVM data to C-Chain format. The main build issues have been resolved by switching from `ethereum/go-ethereum` to `luxfi/geth` imports.

## Completed Work

### 1. Import Path Migration ✅
- Replaced all `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum` imports with `github.com/luxfi/geth`
- Created local `pkg/rawdb` package for constants not exported by luxfi/geth
- Fixed duplicate function definitions
- All main tools now build successfully

### 2. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive [Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
- Added [Subnet Migration README](README-SUBNET-MIGRATION.md)
- Updated existing documentation for clarity

### 3. Tool Organization ✅
- Created `build-all.sh` script to build all tools systematically
- Fixed compilation errors in main genesis tool
- Organized tools by functionality

### 4. Database Analysis ✅
- Identified that migrated database contains only state trie nodes
- Discovered missing blockchain data (headers, bodies, receipts)
- Understood the need for Snowman consensus metadata generation

## Current Issues

### 1. Missing Blockchain Data
The migrated database at `/tmp/migrated-chaindata/pebbledb` contains only state trie nodes (Merkle Patricia Trie), not the full blockchain data needed for consensus.

**Solution**: Need to either:
- Find the original subnet database with complete blockchain data
- Use `subnet-to-cchain-replayer` to reconstruct the missing data

### 2. Consensus State Generation
The Snowman consensus engine requires its own metadata that doesn't exist in Ethereum-style databases.

**Status**: Tools created but need testing with real data

### 3. Some Tools Still Failing to Build
- `import-consensus.go` - Database interface issues
- `import-consensus-simple.go` - Logger interface mismatch
- `replay-consensus.go` - Unused imports

## Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. Fix remaining build issues in consensus import tools
2. Test migration with a small subnet database
3. Verify consensus state generation works correctly

### Short Term
1. Create integration test suite
2. Document the complete migration workflow
3. Add validation checks at each step

### Long Term
1. Automate the entire migration process
2. Add progress monitoring and resumability
3. Create rollback procedures

## Key Commands

```bash
# Build all tools
./build-all.sh

# Fix imports
./fix-imports.sh

# Run migration
./bin/migrate-subnet-tool --source /path/to/subnet --target /path/to/cchain

# Generate consensus state
./bin/replay-consensus-pebble --evm /path/to/evm --state /path/to/consensus
```

## Integration Points

### With luxd (node)
- VM initialization checks for existing blocks
- Database wrapper handles prefix addition
- Consensus engine needs proper state

### With geth
- Using luxfi/geth instead of ethereum/go-ethereum
- Database schema matches geth expectations
- RPC methods work with migrated data

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each migration step independently
2. **Integration Tests**: Test full migration pipeline
3. **Smoke Tests**: Verify node starts with migrated data
4. **RPC Tests**: Ensure all RPC methods work correctly

## Known Limitations

1. Direct database writes bypass VersionDB layer
2. Some subnet databases may lack blockchain data
3. Consensus replay is computationally intensive
