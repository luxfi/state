# Chain Data Import Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Successfully integrated geth/coreth into the C-Chain VM**
   - The C-Chain now runs with our custom implementation
   - Chain ID 96369 is properly configured
   - RPC endpoints are functional

2. **Organized chaindata structure**
   - All chaindata is now consolidated in: `genesis/output/mainnet/C/chaindata`
   - Runtime data goes to: `genesis/runtime/mainnet/`
   - No more scattered temp directories

3. **Node is running with**:
   - Network ID: 96369
   - Chain ID: 0x17871 (96369)
   - Genesis Hash: 0xa24e71001a6a59fb52834b2b4e905f08d1598a7da819467ebb8d9da4129f37ce
   - RPC Port: 9630

## Current Status

The Lux node is running with:
- ✅ C-Chain properly initialized with chain ID 96369
- ✅ RPC endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Genesis block in place
- ⚠️  Block height is 0 (only genesis block)

## Test Commands

```bash
# Check chain ID (should return 0x17871)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"eth_chainId","params":[]}' \
  http://localhost:9630/ext/bc/C/rpc

# Check block number
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[]}' \
  http://localhost:9630/ext/bc/C/rpc

# Get balance of an address
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x9011e888251ab053b7bd1cdb598db4f9ded94714","latest"]}' \
  http://localhost:9630/ext/bc/C/rpc
```

## Important Notes

1. The chaindata from `genesis/chaindata/lux-mainnet-96369` is **consensus layer data** from when 96369 was a subnet
2. To get actual blockchain history, we would need the EVM state data from the subnet
3. The current setup starts fresh with only the genesis block

## Next Steps

To import actual historic blockchain data:
1. Locate the subnet EVM state database (not just consensus data)
2. Use appropriate migration tools to convert subnet EVM format to C-Chain format
3. Or run 96369 as a subnet (as it originally was) instead of as the C-Chain

## Launch Script

The node can be started with:
```bash
./genesis/launch-mainnet-with-chaindata.sh
```

This will:
- Use chaindata from `genesis/output/mainnet/C/chaindata`
- Store runtime data in `genesis/runtime/mainnet/`
- Log to `genesis/runtime/mainnet.log`
